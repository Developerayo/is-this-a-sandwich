# Is this a Sandwich

> _well, is it?_

I made this site in roughly a day to answer the age-old question, **"is it a sandwich?"**

We'll learn a lot about ourselves, each other, and sandwiches. And in the process, we'll probably yell. I'm very excited for people to yell at me, at eachother, and maybe it's all about the sandwiches that weren't actually sandwiches along the way.

I fully do not intend to maintain this, really. Feel free to submit the most pedantic PRs in the world, just please don't expect me to spend much time reviewing them :)

This repo is dedicated to Jason Lengstorf, who will absolutely hate my scoring system.
